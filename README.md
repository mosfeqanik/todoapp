# todo_app



## Objective:

1. Make a todo list app.

2. Onboarding Page:
   Design a standard onboarding page that will appear only once.
3. Home Page:
   Create a home page that displays all the to-dos, whether they are completed or not.
   Implement a dialog to add new to-dos from the home page.
4. To-Do Details Page:
   Build a to-do details page where users can edit or delete existing to-dos.
5. Choice of Storage:
   You can choose any method for storing the to-dos, such as sqflite, Firestore, or any other approach you prefer.
6. UI Responsiveness:
   Ensure that the UI is responsive and compatible with different screen sizes.

7. Make an device information page and redirect it from home page, where device's MAC address and Current IP address will be shown.

Points to be noted:
We don't want to limit you to any specific state management approach; please do not use the setState method anywhere in the project. The same goes for the UI â€“ choose any UI that you think is suitable for this project/task.
Please avoid spaghetti coding and aim for a well-structured and well-architected solution.
The entire development process should be conducted on GitHub. Create a public repository and commit at each major step. Don't hesitate to showcase any problems or struggles you encounter during the development process. We want to see every step of your work, including the challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Please do not commit everything only after you finish. We would like to review your progress along the way.
After completion, please provide us with the link to your repository.
We look forward to seeing your expertise in Flutter development and your ability to tackle this project with clean code and proper architectural principles.
Please let us know if you have any questions or need further clarification. We're excited to see your progress!
